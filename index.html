<h1>The John Smith: Legacy</h1>
<p>With the original author of the John Smith texture pack taking a break from texturing, the last version of Minecraft to be completely textured by John Smith himself was 1.2.5.  The Minecraft community has decided to work on some third-party updates to add the missing textures in a manner faithful to the original John Smith. On this site you will find downloads and information about the pack.</p>

<h2>Download Info:</h2>
<p>The downloads below are compatible with MC versions 1.2.x, through to 1.7.x.  Due to the introduction of "Resource Packs" which replace the traditional texture packs, JSL v1.1.x and higher are not compatable with versions of MC prior to 1.6, and vice-versa. Click the images below to get directed to the correct page.</p>
