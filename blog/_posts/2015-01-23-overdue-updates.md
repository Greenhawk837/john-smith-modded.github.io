title: Overdue Updates
---

There have been a lot of updates happening during the past couple months, and we have not updated here about what has been going on. A couple large things that were started last year have finally come into fruition. [@Greenhawk837](https://github.com/Greenhawk837) and
[@Oddface](https://github.com/Oddface) have both been working on complete revamps of the pack. We have had a lot of community additions and textures added to the repositories.

[@Greenhawk837](https://github.com/Greenhawk837) has been working on dust, ore, and ingot update to the pack. The goal is to tie all the mods together with a consistent style. While this only effects the 1.7.x modded repositories there are still a few outliers mods that have not been updated. If there is anything that has not been updated, open an issue [here](https://github.com/John-Smith-Modded/JSTR-1.7.x/issues/new).

[@Oddface](https://github.com/Oddface) has also been hard at work. The goal is to create a legacy version of the John Smith Technician's Remix that has matching ore, stone, sand, and dirt textures. This version is going to be very appealing to players that are moving from the vanilla version of the pack to the John Smith Technician's Remix version of the pack. This new patch can be downloaded from the [modded](/jstr-modded/) download page. Please note that this patch should be applied on top of the normal modded universal download.


Finally, we would like to give a shout out to all the contributors that have added some amazing textures to pack. [@lesdmark](https://github.com/lesdmark) has been doing amazing work on blood magic. The textures and guis that have been made are great. Check out the commits [here](https://github.com/John-Smith-Modded/JSTR-1.7.x/commits/738013ec974143c80f4d8c6b38464627711f246f?author=lesdmark). Along with that [@Oddface](https://github.com/Oddface) has ported some mods from the 1.6.x repository to the 1.7.x. We also had [@damonmensch](https://github.com/damonmensch) send us a pull request for some ic2 fixes which have been graciously accepted and rolled out. Check out the changes [here](https://github.com/John-Smith-Modded/JSTR-1.7.x/commit/81aec86db9ff1df8b49013e60ffe05cdcd537108). Thanks again to everybody!

Also remember if anybody is interested in contributing textures, just open an issue on the github repo [here](https://github.com/John-Smith-Modded/JSTR-1.7.x/issues/new), and copy your textures directly into the issue content. Plenty of people are always around to help, so if you need advice on creating textures, stop by and ask.
