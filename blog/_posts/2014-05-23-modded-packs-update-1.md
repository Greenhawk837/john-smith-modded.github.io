title: Modded Pack Updates
---

So there has been a lot of activity on the modded repos in the past weeks. If you take a look at the [code frequency chart](https://github.com/John-Smith-Modded/JSTR-1.6.x/graphs/code-frequency) you can see over the past week there has been a huge amount of additions and changes. Another highlight is the addition of the [1.7.x repo](https://github.com/John-Smith-Modded/JSTR-1.7.x). A big thanks to @kardain for all his hard work and commits to the repos. He really has been adding new content, updating old mods, and getting everything up to extraordinary high levels of quality.




### Modpack Update details:
So the modded downloads page has been updated with details on the new modpack downloads. These packs were compiled with the latest repo files as of the posting of this blog post. We will hopefully get some sort of an automated system up and running with getting these packs auto updating, but that is for the future. We have added many of the ftb packs and technic packs. The full list is on the [downloads page](/jstr-modded/) where you can see all the options. The universal packs contain all mods from the modded repo. 

Along with this, the base vanilla pack used by all these modded packs has been updated. It now has several elements that are separate then the original John Smith Legacy downloads. These include smooth stone, different netherrack, and other details that help make it look better in game. You can check out what files are changed on the John Smith Technician's Remix overwrite [repo](https://github.com/John-Smith-Modded/JSTR-Overwrites). Enjoy!
