title: Site Changes and Updates

So many updates within the same week! We have a lot of great things coming online now. One of the biggest things we have is the offical introduction of the 64x version of the pack. [@Greenhawk837](https://github.com/Greenhawk837) and
[@TitaN655](https://github.com/TitaN655) have been hard at work creating a 64x version of the pack. We are very glad that they have joined the website and provided downloads for our [vanilla page](/jstr-vanilla/). The vanilla page has been changed to reflect these changes.

On the top of the page, the normal 32x version of the pack can be downloaded through a link to [@JimStoneCraft](http://www.minecraftforum.net/members/JimStoneCraft) website. Below is the downloads of the 64x versions of the pack. The 64x version of the pack is still considered a *work in progress*, so we recommend that you apply it overtop the 32x version of the pack. By applying it over, you guarantee that you are getting the best textures for your world. These packs are compiled from the github repo, which can be found [here](https://github.com/John-Smith-64x/). Feel free to contribute textures or just check out the recent work there.

### Modpack Update details:

Along with this the 1.6.x and 1.7.x modded universal have been updated. So much has been done since the last update and it is hard to summarize everything. Through the many contributers like [@Oddface](https://github.com/Oddface), [@kardain](https://github.com/kardain), [@ebeneezersquid](https://github.com/ebeneezersquid), and [@Satellence](https://github.com/Satellence) no textures would be made for the update. So a big shoutout to them, as they are the sole reason this update was about to happen. We have increased each pack by about 15mbs, so loads of good textures have been added. Check out the commit history links below, and make sure you go download the latest packs from the [downloads page](/jstr-modded/).
