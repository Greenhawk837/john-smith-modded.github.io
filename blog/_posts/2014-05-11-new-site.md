title: Welcome to the New Site
---

Welcome to the site! This site was created to respond to the community demand for more of the John Smith texture pack. This whole website is open source and is on our [github](https://github.com/John-Smith-Modded). We are still actively developing it, and strive to continue to increase the quality. Make sure you have a look around, and check out the packs offered.

### What is this site?

We want to hear feedback- bring us your positive and negative opinions! Feel free to leave feedback on what this site should or shouldn't have on the minecraft forums. This website will serve as a central portal for all things John Smith Legacy related. We'll always provide information, updates, and downloads of the pack through this medium and on the minecraft forums. We plan on continuing to update everybody on what is happening in the John Smith Legacy and John Smith Technician's Remix packs through these blog post and on the minecraft forums.

### What is to come?

There are many surprises and things we have in store for everybody. Soon we will be hopefully releasing a updated version of the patcher. We hope to have to create an integrated changelog and many other things. Along with this we hope to streamline the creation of modded textures and get more people involved in creating them! So thank you again and enjoy the pack!
