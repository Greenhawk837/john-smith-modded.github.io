title: Download Link Updates
---

The downloads page has been updated to new download urls. The file hosting has been moved to the curse network, as this allows for easy updating and allows for the packs to reach a wider audience. The hope is that this is a step in increasing the ease of both updating the packs, and getting downloads to people. The custom pack downloads have been removed, as the universals can now cover all the packs. This should simplify downloading and updating. If anybody has any questions please post on the forums and we would be happy to answer them.
